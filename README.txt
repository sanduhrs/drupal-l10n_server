Localization server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The localization server project (formerly known as lt_server) provides a 
community localization editor, which allows people from around the world to 
collaborate on translating projects to different languages, especially for 
Drupal. It is inspired by Launchpad Rosetta (https://launchpad.net/rosetta) 
but is highly adapted to Drupal needs.
